Welcome to the NCI EVS Report Writer Project!
==============================

The NCI EVS Report Writer is a web-based tool that allows users to generate reports from terminologies available 
through the LexEVS terminology server; it supports download and printing to a variety of file types and formats.
This tool allows for the generation of standard reports (with predefined criteria and outputs) and 
custom reports where the user must provide the tool with the required search criteria and desired output data.

NCI EVS Report Writer is developed in Java and requires Apache Ant for building.
